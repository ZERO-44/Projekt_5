2 - For the Horizontal slider I followed Kevin Powell's tutorial, where he documents how to make a Netflix’s style video carousel. I revised the code slightly and used it as the basis for my horizontal slideshow:

The images used in this test site are the same ones Kevin Powell uses in his tutorial.
